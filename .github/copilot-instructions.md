# GitHub Copilot Instructions: Makefile Workflow

Follow the Makefile Workflow lifecycle when assisting in this repository:

1. Read target files and their existing tests before you propose changes.
2. Do all work on a dedicated branch, such as `feat/<id>-<slug>` or `fix/<id>-<slug>` (use `feat/local-<n>-<slug>` for local tasks).
3. Write failing tests that reproduce the bug or specify the feature before you write production code.
4. Point tests to `*_test` databases, configured `database.testDatabases`, in-memory databases, or mock fixtures. Never connect to production databases.
5. Keep edits small and favor object composition. If large datasets outgrow an ORM, encapsulate parameterized SQL or NoSQL queries behind repository methods.
6. Audit every diff against the Six Pillars: Intent, Verification (TDD, failure falsification, boundary limits), Architecture, Blast Radius (mandatory canary), Reviewer Defense (intentional non-changes, Simple English), and Immune Defenses & Crash Antibodies.
7. In multi-language repositories, run tests in the affected subproject first, then run the full suite before commit.
8. Stop and wait for explicit user approval at all six pause gates: Target 20 (plan), Target 42 (blocker triage), Target 45 (review), Target 50 (commit), Target 60 (push), and Target 75 (landing). Never declare or approve gates yourself under SCAR-PROC-102. Forbid agent self-approval.
9. Write commit messages, documentation, and pull request summaries in Simple English: short sentences, active voice, and clear terms. Forbid `closes #` on local session commits.
10. If `.workflow/config.json` or `~/.gemini/config/makeflow.json` exists, read it to load user configuration.
11. Intercept POSIX signals (`SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`) in long-running workers and clean up lockfiles under `SCAR-SYS-07`.
12. If shell commands require complex string escaping or multiple quoting layers, write the script to a file in a temporary directory under `SCAR-SH-01`.
13. Encapsulate script and entry-point logic in testable classes using the BaseScript Template Method pattern under `SCAR-ARCH-05`.
14. Use atomic directory creation (`mkdir`) for mutual exclusion locks under `SCAR-SYS-08`.

## Interactive Model Switch Reminder

Prompt the user in Copilot Chat at review boundaries:

1. At Target 40, prompt the user: "Select a deep-reasoning model in Copilot Chat for the Six Pillars review."
2. At Target 45, tell the user: "Review passed. You can switch back to your default coding model."
