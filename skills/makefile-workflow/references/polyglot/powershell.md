# Polyglot Stack Guide: PowerShell

This guide covers detection markers, test and lint commands, smoke test templates, and isolation rules for PowerShell.

## 1. Detection Markers

Look for these files when scanning a PowerShell module or script directory:

- `*.ps1`, `*.psm1`, `*.psd1`

## 2. Standard Commands

Run these commands with `pwsh`:

- Targeted Test: `pwsh -Command "Invoke-Pester -Path <path> -Output Detailed"`
- Lint: `pwsh -Command "Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path . -Recurse -EnableExit"`

## 3. Smoke Test Template

If no Pester suite exists, create `tests/Smoke.Tests.ps1`:

```powershell
Describe 'Smoke Test Harness' {
    It 'Runs cleanly' {
        $true | Should -Be $true
    }
}
```

## 4. Test Isolation

Follow three isolation rules in PowerShell tests:

1. Use the `Mock` command in Pester to stub external cmdlets such as `Invoke-RestMethod` or `Send-MailMessage`.
2. Use Pester `TestDrive:` or temporary `PSDrive` roots for file operations during tests.
3. Remove temporary variables and drives inside the `AfterAll` block.
