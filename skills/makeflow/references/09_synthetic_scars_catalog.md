# 09. Synthetic Scars Master Catalog and Routing Index

This manual serves as the Master Routing Index for all Synthetic Scars (engineering rules codified from past operational failures).

## 1. Hub-and-Spoke and Two-Tier Architecture

Synthetic Scars operate across a Two-Tier Architecture:

1. **Tier 1 (Core Built-In Scars)**: Universal engineering rules live in `skills/makeflow/references/scars/` and `skills/makeflow/references/polyglot/`.
2. **Tier 2 (Project-Local Scars)**: Workspace-specific domain rules live in `.workflow/scars/` (for example `.workflow/scars/local.md` or `.workflow/scars/*.md`).

To scale the synthetic scar catalog to hundreds of community contributions without hitting context limits (`SCAR-PROC-99`) or causing Git merge conflicts, scars are organized into a **Hub-and-Spoke** architecture:

    ├── typescript_node.md           <-- SCAR-LANG-TYPESCRIPT-*
    └── ... (27 languages)
```

### Numbering Rules
1. **Category-Scoped Sequencing**: Scars are ordered monotonically within each category spoke file.
2. **End-of-Sequence Appending**: When adding a new scar, assign the next sequential integer and append it to the end of the appropriate category file.
3. **Full Language Names**: Language-specific failure vaccines use full uppercase language names: `SCAR-LANG-<FULL_LANGUAGE>-<NN>`.
4. **Four-Part Anatomy**: Every scar in a spoke file must record:
   - **Wound**: The exact bug, data loss, or broken build that happened.
   - **Trap**: The false assumption or shortcut that caused the failure.
   - **Permanent Reflex**: The mandatory rule that prevents recurrence.
   - **Socratic Probe**: A concise heuristic inquiry that tests attention against the specific failure mode during execution.

### Socratic Reflex Protocol

Rules alone can be mechanically recited without changing reasoning behavior. To prevent cognitive bypass, every synthetic scar includes a **Socratic Probe** (a focused diagnostic inquiry).

Agents must use Socratic Probes during:
1. **Target 15 & Target 20 (Archaeology & Planning)**: Interrogate design assumptions against catalog failure modes before writing code.
2. **Target 30 (Implementation Loops)**: Evaluate whether proposed edits introduce unnecessary abstractions, violate hermetic isolation, or alter unreviewed code.
3. **Target 40 (Adversarial Review)**: Scrutinize diffs using probe questions to uncover silent regressions and unhandled failure modes.

## 3. Scar Creation Lifecycle and Target 90 Rules

### 3.1 Ticket-Scoped Core Scars (Tier 1)

1. If a core scar is a ticket deliverable, scope it during archaeology at Target 15.
2. Plan the spoke file, routing row, and unit tests in `.workflow/state/20_plan.md` at Target 20.
3. Implement and test the scar with `tdd-worker` at Target 30 on a feature branch.
4. Audit the scar diff with `adversarial-critic` at Target 40 before merging.
5. Target 90 never creates or modifies core catalog files on `main`.
6. At Target 90, record only merged scar IDs in `.workflow/history.json` and `.workflow/history.md`.

### 3.2 Incidental Retrospective Lessons and Project-Local Scars (Tier 2)

1. Inside the `makeflow-skill` repository, record incidental session lessons in ticket notes as candidates for a future feature request ticket.
2. Inside external user projects, offer to record project-specific lessons in `.workflow/scars/local.md` (or `.workflow/scars/*.md`) during Target 90.
3. Format each project-local scar with the Wound, Trap, Permanent Reflex, and Socratic Probe fields.
4. Record earned project-local scar IDs in `.workflow/history.json` and `.workflow/history.md`.
